hello! hope you're doing good. a very happy teacher's day as well to all teachers out there. context of writing on Pydantic is similar to last blog. if you didn't checkout it yet, read it [here](/posts/spell-check).

last night, my team was discussing about how to bring json serialization in our model (it's complex one) and incorporates external APIs. i just looked into JSON mode (supported in chat completion APIs) and found "pydantic" there.

let's discuss about problem first.
as you all know python lacks static typing (type of variables aren't declared unlike java or c).

```python
x = 10
```

and now in java 

```java 
int x = 10;
```

we can infer python overwrites variables as well from here. meaning, if 4 (int) is assigned to a variable x, we can also assign "four" (string) to x. basically, 4 got overwritten by "four".

it may look easier as we get started but cause a lots of problem later on.

as the application get bigger it becomes harder to keep track of all variables and what type they should be.

let's discuss an example code-

```python
smith = Person("smith", 24)
smith = Person("smith, "24")
```

the biggest downside with this approach is it allows us to create invalid objects.
here, when we try to use the "age" variable as a number it will fail (now it is assigned as string).
also, it becomes quite hard to debug in a large codebase.

Python has a lot of tools already to solve this kind of problem like dataclass, type-hinting etc.

First, we're going to look over pydantic then we'll compare with existing tools.
what pydantic is?
in most simpler terms, it is data validation library in python. You may find using pydantic in top python libraries like huggingface/transformer, fastapi, langchain, airflow etc.
It has varied benefits:

- ide type hints 
- data validation
- json serialization

how to use pydantic?

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

- pydantic uses BaseModel for creating pydantic models (see the code below). Here User is a class that inherits from BaseModel class. in User class, we define fields of model as class variables
- we can use Data Validation feature by pydantic to validate type of variables. in User class, we define name: Str, if we create an instance user1 with name: 2, this will output a validation error.
- EmailStr is used to validate email.
- in pydantic, we can create Custom Validations. what are custom validations? if none of in-built validation types cover the requirements we need, we add custom validation logic to the model. here, let the logic be "all account_id" must be positive integers. we'll add validator decorator from pydantic to our class.
- pydantic has **JSON Serialization** feature. It is used in converting pydantic models to JSON and vice-versa. while converting pydantic model to JSON, we call JSON method on model instance. This will return JSON string representation of model's data.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr
    account_id: int

    # Data Validation
    @validator("account_id")
    def validate_account_id(cls, value):
     if value<=0:
        raise ValueError(f"account_id must be positive: {value}")
     return value



#creating instance of the model
user1 = User(
    name="himanshu",
    email="hdubey261102@gmail.com",
    account_id= 20211234
)
print(user1)

user2 = User(name="xyz", email="abc@gmail.com", account_id=2345)
print(user2.email)

#this will be invalid, account_id = int -> str
user2 = User(name="abc", email="pqr@gmail.com", account_id= "12346")
print(user2)

# JSON Serialization
# to convert pydantic models to JSON, we can call JSON method on the model instance.
# this will return a JSON string representation of model's data

user_json_str = user1.json()
print(user_json_str)

# if you don't want json string but plane python dictionary
user_json_obj = user1.dict()
print(user_json_obj)

# if you've json string and want to convertit back into pydantic model
json_str = {"name":"xyz","email":"abc@gmail.com","account_id":2345}
user3 = User.model_validate(json_str)
print(user3)
```

let's compare pydantic with dataclass.

- dataclass is actually a built-in module that solves similar problem as pydantic except of extending from a BaseModel class, we use `@dataclass` decorator instead. here is the code below

```python
@dataclass
class myProduct:
    name: str
    price: float
    in_stock: bool

product1 = Product("PS5", 70K, True)
```

- dataclass is lightweight (built-in module).
- dataclass requires additional steps or libraries for JSON serialization/deserialization, making the process less straightforward.

```python
import json

product1_dict = asdict(product1)
product1_json = json.dumps(product1_dict)
new_product1_dict = json.loads(product1_json)
new_product1 = Product(**new_product1_dict)
```

- if we have a complex data model, need a lot of JSON Serialization and has a lot of external APIs we will go with pydantic. i guess this makes sense now.\

this is all about pydantic in brief. refer official doc for further use cases.
